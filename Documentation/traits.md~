Traits for entities
-------------------

You will find a lot of traits in steevanb\sf2-utils-traits\Traits namespace, to help you creating your entities.

All traits have a property, and accessors.

By default, annotations set nullable=false, but you can use NullableFoo to have nullable=true.

Some traits can be translated, with @Gedmo\Translatable annotation, and are prefixed by Translatable.

Exemples
--------

- Description is not nullable, not translated
- NullableDescription is nullable, not translated
- TranslatableNullableDescription is nullable, translated
